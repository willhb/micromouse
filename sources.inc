# will not be considered source files but generated files (assembler
# output from the compiler), and will be deleted upon "make clean"!
# Even though the DOS/Win* filesystem matches both .s and .S the same,
# it will preserve the spelling of the filenames, and gcc itself does
# care about how the name is spelled on its command-line.

# A subsystem consists of startup code and linker script
# for a particular operating environment. The currently
# supported subsystems are:
#
#    openlpc - this is the default. Use this subsystem
#      for applications running on top of the OpenLPC supervisor.
#      The output file is a .bin file which can be loaded onto
#      the board using the 'make program' command. Also contains
#      newlib stubs that use the supervisor for usb serial IO.
#
#    bare - subsystem for applications running bare metal.
#      The output file is a .hex file which can be loaded
#      onto the board using FlashMagic and the Philips on-chip
#      serial bootloader.
#
#    custom - you must provide your own linker script and 
#      startup code. If you specify this option, you
#      MUST provide startup code and linker script or your
#      code will not link!! Startup assembly code can
#      be specifed in the ASRC list, and a linker script
#      can be specified with the LDSCRIPT variable
